# Coding_Puzzles

A list of coding puzzles from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and similar, that I solved to practice for interviews.

## Programming Languages

I will initially solve each problem in Python, then jump to C++11, and finally to C#.

### The Reason for This Order:
1. **Python**: I am most comfortable with Python since I used it extensively before getting into graduate school.
2. **C++11**: I have been using C++11 during my High-Performance Computing (HPC) course this last semester, so it is still fresh in my mind.
3. **C#**: I have seen C# mentioned occasionally in job applications, and it feels somewhat similar to Java, so why not practice with it? ðŸ˜„
