# Plus Minus Problem

## Problem Description

The problem asks you to calculate the ratio of positive, negative, and zero values in an array of integers. Given an array, you need to find the following three ratios:
1. The ratio of positive numbers.
2. The ratio of negative numbers.
3. The ratio of zeros.

The result should be printed with a precision of six decimal places.

### Example:

**Input**:
[-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]


**Output**:
0.500000 
0.333333 
0.166667


### Explanation:
- There are 3 positive numbers: `[3, 4, 1]`
- There are 2 negative numbers: `[-4, -9]`
- There is 1 zero: `[0]`

The ratios are:
- Positive: `3 / 6 = 0.500000`
- Negative: `2 / 6 = 0.333333`
- Zero: `1 / 6 = 0.166667`
